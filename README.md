# Smart Host Coding Challenge

This is my submission for Beusable's Frontend Developer coding challenge, which is a React project that calculates the optimal distribution of hotel rooms based on the guests' willingness to pay.

## Installation

To install the project dependencies, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

## Testing

To run the unit tests for the project, run the following command:

```
npm run test
```

The tests are written using `react-testing-library` and `redux-mock-store`.

## Usage

To use the project, simply run the following command:

```
npm start
```

This will launch the development server and open the project in your default web browser.

## Structure

The project follows the standard React project structure. The main components are located in the `src/components` directory, while the Redux store and reducers are located in the `src/redux` directory.

## License

This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the LICENSE.md file for details.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank the Beusable team for providing this coding challenge.
